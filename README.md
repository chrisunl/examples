- [counter](https://github.com/flutter-view/examples/tree/master/counter): a flutter-view + reactive version of the project you get when you create a new Flutter project: a counter with a button
- [todolist](https://github.com/flutter-view/examples/tree/master/todolist): a simple todo list with storage, to show a more complete example of how an app can be structured using flutter-view and the Dart flutter-view-tools library.
