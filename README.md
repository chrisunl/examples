# Flutter-View Examples

This repository contains some examples of how to use flutter-view:

- testdrive: The getting started project as explained in the [*Test Drive* chapter](https://flutter-view.gitbook.io/project/get-started/test-drive) of the documentation.
- counter: a flutter-view + reactive version of the project you get when you create a new Flutter project: a counter with a button
- todolist: a simple todo list with storage, to show a more complete example of how an app can be structured using flutter-view and the Dart flutter-view-tools library.

For more information, please check the [documentation](https://flutter-view.gitbook.io/project/).
