# flutter-view testdrive

This is a starter app to show how to use a flutter-view in your applications. It is used by the [getting started documentation](https://flutter-view.gitbook.io/project/get-started/test-drive) to show a first flutter-view based app.

The most important files are:

- [homepage.pug](lib/pages/homepage/homepage.pug) : creates the hello world page
- [homepage.sass](lib/pages/homepage/homepage.sass) : adds styling to the hello world page
- [main.dart](lib/main.dart) : imports and shows the homepage flutter-view
